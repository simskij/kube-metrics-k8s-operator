# kube-metrics-k8s-operator

## Description

The Kube Metrics k8s operator is a charm that combines:

- [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
- [kube_state_metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
- [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)

into a single charm.
It allows for easy, turn-key monitoring using the charms of the
[Canonical Observability Stack](https://github.com/canonical/cos-lite-bundle/).

## Usage

To deploy this charm using Juju 2.9.0 or later, switch to a model running
on Kubernetes and run:

```shell
$ juju deploy \
    kube-metrics-k8s \
    metrics \
    --channel edge \
    --trust
```

## Relations

The kube-metrics charm offers two relations, `metrics-endpoint` and `grafana-dashboard`.

`metrics-endpoint` implements the provider-side of the `prometheus_scrape` interface, allowing you to relate it to a `prometheus-k8s` charm for automated scraping.

`grafana-dashboard` implements the provider-side of the `grafana_dashboard` interface, allowing you to relate
it to a `grafana-k8s` charm for automated dashboard provisioning.

## OCI Images

This charm uses two OCI images, one for `kube-state-metrics` and one for `node_exporter`. Both images are listed in [metadata.yaml](metadata.yaml).
